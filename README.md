# Data Science annotation Project

### This is my first project for the MSc in Data Science class "Practical Data Science" in AUEB. Fourteen different annotators tried to predict what feelings the author of Iliad tried to provoke as well as what feelings they got. Some of these annotators did the first while the rest did the latter. At first, data cleaning takes place using mainly the pandas library. The different matrices from the excel files were merged while making new columns for IDs to determine which annotator did what. After, the annotators were split into two groups. One group for predicting the feelings the author wanted to provoke and the second group for the annotators who wrote down the fealings that they got from each verse of Iliad. Later on, the missing values were replaced by appropriate values and unwanted columns were dropped. The DataFrame was grouped by "Groups" -As said before one group for predicting feelings and one for annotator's feelings- and Annotator IDs while the ID of each verse was used as an index. Next a list was made, pairing the annotators of each group with one another. Finally, using the said list, The percentage agreement of the annotators was evaluated as well as cohen's kappa and the values were compared so that conclusions could be drawn.
